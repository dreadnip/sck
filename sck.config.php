Provide BOTH sets of API keys for your Stripe account. These can be found in your Stripe Dashboard at: 

- https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys. 

By default, test mode is enabled. When you're ready to begin processing live charges, change this to `false`. No payments using real credit cards can be made when test mode is enabled. Instead, use the test card numbers provided by Stripe:

The currency symbol is whatever you want visitors to see and can be anything you want, either a symbol ($) or "USD".

Certain currencies have the symbol on the right-side of the amount (such as "kr"). Set 'stripe_currency_symbol_location' to either 'left' or 'right' (default is 'left').
